# Streamlit Book Guide with Plotly Visualizations

### by Sarah El Moughrabi

##### This is an interactive book guide which compiles insights from both amazon and goodreads on best selling books. It also has a book randomizer which can be used to get random book recommendations based on the user's category of choice.

This visualizations found within the web app are my first attempts at utilizing the powerful visualization library Plotly in Python

**Guide to navigate your way around the files**

**.py file** : Includes the code for the complete webapp 

**The datasets used are**: 

- **goodreads_books.csv** : has information on books featured on the social platform Goodreads, the top site for book recommendations and reviews. Data includes each book's rating count, author, and average rating.
- **amazon_books.csv** : has information on Amazon bestsellers throughout the years (duplicates exist since some books were bestsellers for more than one year)
- **bookswithgenres.csv** : lists books and their genres, and was used to make the book randomizer
